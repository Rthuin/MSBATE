MSBATE: Our application aims to allow users to have the ultimate experience of music streaming. MSBATE presents the opportunity to register via personal emails. With the registered profiles, our program allows its users to build playlists, view all the albums in the application and also view the songs in the albums individually. And also it has a unique innovative feature that allows users to view all songs based on genre. The beautiful layout which is built by the touches of the professionals is another remarkable feature.
 




Completion Report/Future work

Most of our infrastructure is in place, however with more time we’d like to add some more functionality. These are, in no particular order:

-	Administrator distinction. An admin account would have the necessary permissions to add new music tracks, artists and labels. Some of this code is already in place, but it needs restructuring.

-	Lossless streaming. Currently the platform supports the mp3 format, however ideally tracks should also be stored in .flac format.

-	Tied to the point above, a “supporter” membership would allow users to stream at a higher bitrate and help us cover hosting and streaming costs.

-	A desktop web application similar to spotify or youtube music, to allow users to not be dependent on a browser.

-	Login tokenization for security. Currently our application is in the demonstration phase, therefore does not include any security measures.



Uncompleted Aspects and Future Work
In addition to the achieved milestones in our project, there are crucial aspects that remain incomplete, presenting opportunities for further development and enhancement. These aspects, when addressed, have the potential to make our web application more robust and feature-rich.





1.	Administrator Role Sharing:
o	The introduction of an administrator role would contribute to a more stable web application. With administrators having the authority to approve additions of songs and albums, the system gains a layer of control. The ability to delete items can also be restricted to administrators, providing a more secure environment. Granting the power of user deletion to admins is another aspect that could enhance overall system control.
2.	Album Genre Recommendations:
o	Leveraging album genres, we can implement a recommendation system based on the distribution of genres in the albums to which the user's favorite songs are linked. This recommendation system can provide users with personalized suggestions, enhancing their overall music discovery experience.
By addressing these uncompleted aspects, we aim to elevate our project to a more sophisticated level, delivering additional functionality and an enhanced user experience. The proposed administrator role and genre-based recommendation system are pivotal features that, once implemented, will contribute significantly to the overall success and stability of our web application.
